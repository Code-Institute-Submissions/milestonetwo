# Milestone Project Three

In this prjoect I used my knowledge of Javescript,HTML and CSS to create a page that helps users find 
and hotels, resurants and attractions at their chosen holiday destination.
 
## UX
  This page is primarily targeted at people who are either already at their holiday destination and want to be able to find things to
  do in area as well as for
  people who are trying to pick a holiday destinatio but are not sure if it is the right choice.
  My project keeps things simple for them so they are able to easily see if their destination is the right one for them 


## Features

  In my header and footer I have chosen to be green, I have chose to use this colour its a neutral
  and it also symbolises the the world map, that goes along with the sky blue background.
  I feel this easily gives users the idea what this site if intended for.
  
 
### Existing Features
- My main feature is the search bar, which allows users to search for any location, once the have searched a location then it will 
- generate markers with local attractions, hotels and and resturants.
- I also have a 'Start over' button to allow users to reset the results so that they can research a different destination
- I have also added a small list of populare holiday destinations so users are able to get insparation


### Features Left to Implement
- I have considered adding some sort of search history to allow users to easily retrive pasted searchs
- or even potentially having a comparison feature to help users pick their ideal destination
- Perhaps adding a currancy converter so users are able to also compare spending in various locations.

## Technologies Used
The technologies that I used to complete this project are:
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
- BOOTSTRAP
- Google Maps API 
- Google Fonts


## Testing

The inital set up for this took place on a computre running chrome, however I then went on to test it further using internet explorer, I also went on to test it 
using different screen sizes using both the chrome web developer tool and actually taking to different devices. I found throughout my testing that what working well in chrome 
on a computer screen, did not work so well in 9.7" tablet screen. Which allowed me to go back and make revelent changes.
